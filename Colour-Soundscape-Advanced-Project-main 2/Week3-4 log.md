# Week 3-4: Data collection on CVD and food-related colour judgments.

## What I Did

During these two weeks, I conducted data collection to investigate how people with CVD perceive food colours and how this affects their decision-making process. I created a three-stage survey distributed through Google Forms. This survey aimed to assess participants' abilities to evaluate food freshness, ripeness, and edibility based on colour, while exploring how auditory feedback can assist when visual cues are uncertain.

The survey was structured into three stages:

Stage 1: Participants evaluated their comfort with pure colour stimuli, focusing on colours prone to instability for CVD individuals, particularly the red-green spectrum.

Stage 2: Participants were shown images of food and asked to assess its freshness and edibility based on colour alone. This stage aimed to understand how colour uncertainty influences food-related decisions.

Stage 3: Participants engaged in colour-sound mapping exercises, where they were asked to match tones (such as high-pitched, low-pitched, or rhythmic sounds) with colour samples. This stage explored whether sound could serve as a stabilizing cue, helping participants to make more confident judgments when visual colour cues were uncertain.

The survey was approved by UAL's ethical review committee, ensuring that all necessary ethical standards were met.

## Achievements

* Survey Creation: I designed the three-stage survey to explore colour comfort, food-related colour judgments, and colour-sound relationships. In Stage 1, participants focused on how they perceive specific colours like red and green. Stage 2 tested how participants assess food items like raw meat and fruit based on colour alone. Stage 3 introduced participants to sound mappings, allowing me to evaluate whether auditory feedback could help stabilize food-related colour judgments.

* Pilot Data Collection: The survey received 199 valid responses, with 40% of the respondents self-identifying as having CVD. This dataset enabled me to compare how CVD participants and non-CVD participants responded to different food-related colour cues.

Initial Insights: The analysis of responses revealed:

1. Red-Green Confusion: CVD participants experienced considerable uncertainty when asked to judge the ripeness of fruits like apples. For instance, 48.8% of CVD participants were split between red and green apples, whereas 93.3% of non-CVD participants preferred the red apple.

2. Food Perception: Participants with CVD found it difficult to judge the freshness of raw meat, as the visual cue of "red" lost its clarity, making it hard for them to decide if it was fresh or safe to eat.

3. Impact of Sound Feedback: In Stage 3, the results showed that sound significantly impacted decision-making. CVD participants demonstrated more confidence when auditory feedback aligned with the visual colour information, helping to stabilize their perception and reduce hesitation.

## Challenges

Data Interpretation: Some of the responses in Stage 3 were subjective, especially when it came to how participants chose to match colours with sounds. For example, CVD participants showed more variation in their choices, with some selecting rhythmic sounds for colours like green, while others preferred higher-pitched tones. This highlights the individual variability in how participants respond to colour-sound associations.

Ensuring Accurate Responses: In Stage 2, some participants, especially those with severe CVD, had difficulty using colour alone to judge food freshness. This highlights the need for a more reliable system that uses both colour and sound in tandem to ensure confidence in real-world food choices.

## What I’m Thinking

The data from the survey has reinforced the idea that red-green confusion is a significant challenge for people with CVD when making food-related decisions. The sound mapping experiment (Stage 3) has shown promising results in helping to stabilize the perception of uncertain colours. CVD participants responded better when they could rely on auditory cues to confirm or correct their initial colour judgment. This confirms the potential of sound as a stabilizing sensory cue when vision is unreliable.

## Next Steps

Refine Colour-Sound Mapping: Based on the findings, I will continue refining the sound mappings for problematic colours, like red and green, to ensure they are more effective in real-time use. This will involve experimenting with different types of sounds (e.g., pitch, rhythm) to see which best stabilizes users' colour perceptions.

Follow-up Testing: After finalizing the sound mappings, I plan to conduct more user testing with CVD participants to assess how well the system supports their food-related decision-making in everyday contexts.

Further Data Analysis: As the next step, I will dive deeper into the survey data to identify patterns in how participants with different types of CVD respond to colour, which will help in fine-tuning the system for diverse user needs.
