# Week5-6 log: Sound mapping theory and initial sound design concepts.

## What I Did

These two weeks ended up being much more about thinking than doing. I originally wanted to jump straight into testing sound mappings, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt I needed to slow down and actually understand what “turning colour into sound” means for people with Colour Vision Diversity (CVD). Instead of writing code, I spent a lot of time re-reading the case studies from my thesis, trying to figure out how other designers have approached multisensory translation. It felt a bit like going backwards, but I realised I hadn’t fully absorbed what those works were teaching me. So this week became a kind of self-initiated crash course in the philosophy behind the system I’m trying to build.

* ColorADD Code — A Visual “Language” for Colour

One of the projects I revisited was the ColorADD Code. I’ve seen it before but didn’t really look at it closely until now. The more I studied it, the more fascinated I became with its structure. Every colour has a geometric symbol, and when colours mix, the symbols combine too. It’s not just a workaround for colour blindness; it’s basically a language with grammar. That idea stuck with me: colour can be stabilised by giving it a structure, something predictable. It made me think about whether sound could function the same way. If ColorADD turns colour into shapes people can learn, maybe my project can turn colour into a small set of recognisable sound “behaviours”. That thought alone changed how I approached the whole mapping process.

* Neil Harbisson — Thinking About Colour Beyond Sight

I also rewatched Neil Harbisson’s TED Talk, “I Listen to Color.”I saw it a while ago, but this time I watched it with my project in mind. His relationship with colour is so different from how most of us see it; for him, colour literally is sound. What surprised me wasn’t the technology he uses but how naturally he talks about hearing colours as if it’s the obvious thing to do. It made me realise that sound doesn’t have to be a translation or a replacement—it can become a completely new way of experiencing colour. That shifted my focus: instead of trying to “help” users perceive colour more accurately, maybe the sound in my system can simply be something steady and reassuring, something that makes colour feel more trustworthy even if they don’t see it the way others do.

* Eat2Pic & NOISE — Thinking of My Project as an Experience

Then I went back to the two multisensory installations from my thesis, Eat2Pic and NOISE, and realised they had been influencing me more than I originally noticed. Eat2Pic is playful and a bit whimsical—it turns flavours into dynamic visuals—and something about that looseness made me feel less pressured to make my system too literal. Meanwhile, NOISE uses sound in such a grounded, emotional way that it almost becomes a form of protection or focus. Together, these projects made me reconsider how I want my final installation to feel. I no longer think of it as a “tool” or “device,” but more like a small environment where users can step into a calmer sensory world. The sound isn’t just an audio output; it’s part of the atmosphere.

## Developing My Sound Mapping Rules

With all these influences in mind, I started building my initial rules for how colours might behave as sound. I tried to keep them intuitive: warm colours like red or orange should feel clearer or brighter, while cooler colours like green should feel softer and calmer. Brighter colours could have higher pitches, and darker colours lower ones. And interestingly, based on the Stage 3 results from my survey, CVD users seemed to respond well to rhythm when colour felt ambiguous—so I decided uncertain colours might have a more rhythmic pattern. These ideas are still rough, but they at least give me something to hold onto as I shape the direction of the sound system.

### First Experiments with Suno

Since I wasn’t prototyping visually yet, I spent some time experimenting with sound generation using Suno. I made little audio sketches for the main colours in my system—red, yellow, green, brown, and purple. They’re definitely not final (some honestly feel like dramatic movie intros), but they helped me start imagining how each colour might eventually “feel” in sound. It was also helpful to actually hear how different tones and timbres create different emotional responses. These early experiments gave me a better idea of which directions I want to avoid, like sounds that are too musical or too busy.

## What I’m Struggling With

One of the biggest challenges is figuring out how to make all the sounds belong to the same “family.” I don’t want each colour to sound like it came from a different app or a different composer. They need to feel related, but still distinct enough to be recognisable. Another issue is emotional tone—many generated sounds are too energetic. The last thing I want is for users to feel like the system is performing a show every time it detects a colour. I want something stable, calm, and consistent.

## What I’m Thinking Now

After spending two weeks with these references and rough sound ideas, I’m starting to feel more confident about the direction. I don’t think my project is about correcting colour perception at all. It’s more about helping users feel less uncertain, especially when visual cues are unreliable. The ColorADD Code gave me the idea of sound as a structured language, Harbisson reminded me that sound can be a legitimate sensory channel for colour, and Eat2Pic and NOISE pushed me toward thinking of the whole thing as an experience. My job now is to take all of this and slowly turn it into something meaningful—something gentle and usable.

## Next Steps

For now, I’m going to keep refining the sound sketches and figure out a clearer emotional profile for each colour. I also want to think more carefully about how sound might behave when colours mix. Before touching any camera or real-time detection, I want to run a small sound-only test to see whether these early ideas even make sense to people.
