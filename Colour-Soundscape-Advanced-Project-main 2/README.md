# Colour Soundscape - MSc Final Project

## Project Overview

Colour Soundscape is an interactive system designed to assist individuals with Colour Vision Diversity (CVD) by providing auditory feedback to stabilize visual uncertainty. CVD affects millions of individuals globally, causing difficulty in distinguishing certain colours, particularly in everyday tasks like food selection. This project aims to enhance the perception of colour through sound, offering a multisensory solution that fosters confidence and emotional clarity when visual cues are ambiguous.

The system leverages real-time colour-to-sound mapping using sensors and sound engines, with a focus on creating perceptual trust. By integrating colour detection with layered musical tones, the Colour Soundscape aims to provide a more intuitive way for individuals with CVD to navigate the world.

## Research Background

Colour is a crucial signal in human perception, especially when it comes to food. However, for individuals with CVD, colour cues often become unstable, leading to hesitation and misinterpretation. This research explores how sound can supplement the visual uncertainty created by CVD, offering an alternative sensory cue to stabilize perception and improve decision-making.

Through a series of experiments, data analysis, and user testing, the project investigates how different colours and sounds correspond to each other, and how these sensory relationships can be used in practical design applications. The system aims not to replace vision but to provide an additional layer of support, helping users make better decisions when visual information is unreliable.

## System Overview

Colour Soundscape consists of two main components:

 * Colour Detection System

**Hardware:**  A USB-connected camera (replacing the unstable ESP32-CAM module) captures the colour information of objects in real-time.

**Software:** OpenCV handles the image processing, detecting the dominant colour and analyzing its attributes (hue, brightness, saturation).

* Sound Mapping Engine

**Platform:** Processing-Java

**Process:** Suno is used to generate audio files for different colours. These pre-generated sounds are mapped to corresponding colour attributes. Bright and warm colours are matched with higher-pitched sounds, while cool colours are mapped to lower, rhythmic tones.

**Integration:** The audio files generated by Suno are stored in the Processing library, which triggers the appropriate sound based on real-time colour detection.

## User Experience and Feedback

User feedback is an essential aspect of this project, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of the auditory cues in assisting users with Colour Vision Diversity (CVD).

* User Interaction: Users engage with the system by observing objects and listening to the corresponding sounds. This interaction helps them navigate colour uncertainty and make more confident decisions based on the auditory cues provided.

* User Testing Insights: Through testing, it was observed that sound played a significant role in stabilizing the users' confidence in making colour-related decisions. Participants with CVD found the sound feedback to be reassuring, improving their ability to interpret ambiguous colours, particularly in food selection scenarios.

* Impact of Auditory Feedback: Users reported that the sounds not only clarified their perception but also provided an emotional anchor, reducing the hesitation they often experience with certain colours. This interaction demonstrated the power of multisensory feedback in enhancing user experience and confidence.

## Future Directions

While Colour Soundscape offers an innovative solution for individuals with Colour Vision Diversity (CVD), there are several ways the system could be expanded and improved:

* Scalability: The system could be adapted to support a wider range of colours and more complex environments. For example, expanding the system to detect and map colours in dynamic settings like outdoor environments or stores could further enhance its practicality.

* Mobile Integration: Future iterations could integrate with mobile devices, allowing users to carry the system with them and receive auditory feedback on the go. This would make the solution more portable and versatile for everyday use.

* Advanced Personalization: By incorporating machine learning, the system could be personalized to each user's unique perception of colour. This would allow the auditory feedback to be dynamically adjusted based on individual needs and preferences, improving the user experience.

* Real-time Application in Public Spaces: The system could be deployed in public spaces, such as grocery stores, where it could provide real-time auditory feedback to help individuals with CVD navigate their environment and make better decisions when choosing food or other products.

## Conclusion

In this project, I explored how sound can help individuals with CVD navigate the uncertainty of colour perception. Through Colour Soundscape, I aimed to create an intuitive system that combines real-time colour detection with auditory feedback, offering users a way to confidently interpret and interact with their environment.

From my research and user testing, it became clear that auditory cues play a significant role in boosting confidence and improving decision-making, especially when colours are ambiguous. The system showed promise in providing a supportive experience, where users felt more assured when making decisions based on sound, especially in everyday situations like food selection.

I believe there's great potential to expand it further. Future iterations could include more personalized and dynamic experiences, tailored to individual needs. Additionally, the system could be adapted to real-world environments, making it more accessible to those with CVD in daily life.

Ultimately, this project has shown me the value of multisensory design in making everyday tasks more accessible, and I’m excited about the possibilities of continuing to develop this idea to create a more inclusive experience for people with sensory impairments.🌟
